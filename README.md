# About Me Page

The page is built with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## How To Dev

Run `npm run dev` to start the tailwind compiler. The tailwind compiler is watching for changes in `styles/tailwind.css` and compiles to the `src` directory.

Open `index.html` in `/scr` in the browser and start developing.
